📘 Array Operations in C++

🧾 Description :-

This is a simple C++ program that demonstrates basic array operations using a static array. The program provides a menu-driven interface to:

Insert an element at the end

Insert an element at a specified position

Delete an element from a specified position

It uses a fixed-size array (maximum 50 elements) and keeps track of the current number of elements.

🚀 Features :-

  Menu-based interface for user interaction
  
  Insert at end and at a specific position
  
  Delete element from a given position
  
  Proper boundary and overflow checks
  
  Dynamic display of current array contents
